<h1/>BankServer(sockets, pthreads) </h1>
<h2/>Introduction </h2>
A network application with sockets and threads (Pthreads). The bank server keeps data for bank accounts and bank clients are connecting to the server to make transactions. The server has a thread pool and uses a thread for each client connection request. To keep the data for each account is uses a threadsafe hashtable. I have implement my own list, queue and hashtable because i wasnt allowed to use stl in my class.
<h2/>Compile</h2>
Make command to compile and make clean to remove all object files.
<h2/>Run	</h2></h2>
<h3/>For the server</h3>
./server -p &ltport&gt -s <thread_pool_size> -q <queue_size>

<port>: port number which will be used by the socket to receive connection from clients
<thread_pool_size>: The number of working threads in the thread pool
<queue_size>: The size of the queue

./client -h <server_host> -p <server_port> -i <command_file>
<server_host>: The address (name) of the server machine
<server_port> : The port of the server, so the client can connect to it
<command_file> : The file with the commands to the server

Admins can also make a user moderator or admin.
