<h1/>BankServer(sockets, pthreads) </h1>
<h2/>Introduction </h2>
A network application with sockets and threads (Pthreads). The bank server keeps data for bank accounts and bank clients are connecting to the server to make transactions. The server has a thread pool and uses a thread for each client connection request. To keep the data for each account is uses a threadsafe hashtable. I have implement my own list, queue and hashtable because i wasnt allowed to use stl in my class.
<h2/>Compile</h2>
Make command to compile and make clean to remove all object files.

./server -p &lt; port &gt; -s &lt;thread_pool_size&gt; -q &lt;queue_size&gt;

&lt;port&gt;: port number which will be used by the socket to receive connection from clients
&lt;thread_pool_size&gt;: The number of working threads in the thread pool
&lt;queue_size&gt;: The size of the queue

<b/>For the client</b></br>
./client -h &lt;server_host&gt; -p &lt;server_port&gt; -i &lt;command_file&gt;
